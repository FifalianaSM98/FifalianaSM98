### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

-ðŸ‘‹Hi, I'm Fifaliana, I'm a student in Marine sciences, actually I'm a student of SAYNA too. It's digital school to learn all digitals jobs with a good family and game away.

I'm interested in code but I am not developer, sorry!, I'm interested too in management and conservation of biodiversity and laterly I would like to contribute in the conservation of marine wildlife such as sea turtles and marine mammals.

I'm currently learning all things about development and specifically how to learn it. At he same time, I'm a student in IHSM, an institute of Marine sciences from Tulear Madagascar.

I'm looking to collaborate on many projects to see all the methodology development in the world, good luck for me!
